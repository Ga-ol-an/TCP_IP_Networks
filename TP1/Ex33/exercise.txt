33. Obtain and build the simplex-talk sample socket program shown in
the text. Start one server and one client, in separate windows. While
the first client is running, start 10 other clients that connect to the
same server; these other clients should most likely be started in the
background with their input redirected from a file. What happens to
these 10 clients? Do their connect()s fail, time out, or succeed? Do any
other calls block? Now let the first client exit. What happens? Try this
with the server value MAX_PENDING set to 1 as well.
