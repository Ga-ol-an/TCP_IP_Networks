35. Modify the simplex-talk socket program so that it uses UDP as
the transport protocol rather than TCP. You will have to change
SOCK_STREAM to SOCK_DGRAM in both client and server. Then, in
the server, remove the calls to listen() and accept(), and replace the
two nested loops at the end with a single loop that calls recv() with
socket s. Finally, see what happens when two such UDP clients
simultaneously connect to the same UDP server, and compare this
to the TCP behavior.
